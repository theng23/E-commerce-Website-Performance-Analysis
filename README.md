# üìä E-commerce Website Performance Analysis | SQL, BigQuery
## üìë I. Introduction
This project contains an eCommerce dataset that i will explore by using SQL on Google BigQuery. The dataset is based on the Google Analytics public dataset and contains data from an eCommerce website. Using this dataset, queries are executed to analyze website activity in 2017, including calculating the bounce rate, identifying days with the highest revenue, examining user behavior on pages, and performing other forms of analysis.
The goal of creating this project
  - Overview of website activity
  - Bounce rate analysis
  - Revenue analysis
  - Transactions analysis
  - Products analysis
## üìñ II. Requirements
- Google Cloud Platform account
- Project on Google Cloud Platform
- Google BigQuery API enabled
- SQL query editor or IDE
## üìÇ III. Dataset Access
1. The eCommerce dataset is stored in a public Google BigQuery dataset. To access the dataset, follow these steps:
  - Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account and create a new project.
  - Navigate to the BigQuery console and select your newly created project.
  - In the navigation panel, select "Add Data" and then "Search a project".
  - Enter the project ID "bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions" and click "Enter".
  - Click on the "ga_sessions_" table to open it.

## ‚öíÔ∏è IV. Exploring the Dataset
### **Query 01: calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017 (order by month)**

- SQL Code:
```sql

SELECT 
  FORMAT_DATE("%Y%m", PARSE_DATE("%Y%m%d", date)) AS month, --Find Jan, Feb and March
  SUM(totals.visits) AS visits, --total visits
  SUM(totals.pageviews) AS pageviews, --total pagevies
  SUM(totals.transactions) AS transactions, --total transaction
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '0101' AND '0331' --condition to get month 
GROUP BY 1 
ORDER BY 1; --sorting month

```
- Result:

|month|visits|pageviews|transactions|
|-----|------|---------|------------|
|01   |64694 |257708   |713         |
|02   |62192 |233373   |733         |
|03   |69931 |259522   |993         |

A positive upward trend is observed across all three metrics from February to March. With February showing the lowest site visits, it may be beneficial to explore underlying factors contributing to this dip.
### **Query 02: Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017 (Bounce_rate = num_bounce/total_visit) (order by total_visit DESC)**
- SQL Code
```sql
SELECT
  trafficSource.source
  ,SUM(totals.visits) AS total_visit --total visits
  ,SUM(totals.bounces) AS total_no_of_bounces --total bounces
  ,ROUND(SUM(totals.bounces)/SUM(totals.visits) * 100,3) AS bounce_rate --find bounce rate
FROM 
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`
GROUP BY
  trafficSource.source
ORDER BY --sorting by total visits
  total_visit DESC;

```

The result presents a summary of website traffic from different sources and key metrics used to assess user engagement and behaviours. It focuses on four main elements: source, total_visits, total_no_bounces and bounce_rate.

The top source of traffic to the website is Google however significant bounce rate(51.557&).Meanwhile, direct visits show a lower bounce rate (43.266%) and are the second-largest contributor to traffic. Additionally, platforms like YouTube and Facebook have high bounce rates, suggesting potential areas for improvement in user retention strategies.

Some traffic sources, like "gophergala.com," "kik.com," and "malaysia.search.yahoo.com," show a 100% bounce rate, suggesting visitors leave immediately without further interaction. This indicates potential mismatches between user expectations and the content or landing pages for these sources, worth investigating further.

### **Query 04: Average number of pageviews by purchaser type (purchasers vs non-purchasers) in June, July 2017.**
- SQL Code
```sql

WITH purchaser_data AS( --find a purchaser
  SELECT
      FORMAT_DATE("%Y%m",PARSE_DATE("%Y%m%d",date)) AS month
      ,(SUM(totals.pageviews)/COUNT(DISTINCT fullvisitorid)) AS avg_pageviews_purchase --avgerate pageview purchase

|201707|124.23755186721992    |334.05655979568053        |

Purchasers have lower average pageviews compared to non-purchasers, but from June to July 2017, purchasers' average pageviews increased significantly by 30.22%, while non-purchasers' pageviews rose modestly by 5.42%. This suggests improved engagement for purchasers, while non-purchasers may still struggle with decision-making or navigation.

### **Query 05: Average number of transactions per user that made a purchase in July 2017**

|month|Avg_total_transactions_per_user|
|-----|-------------------------------|
|201707|4.16390041493776               |

Average total transactions per user in July 2017 is 4.1639. This information serves to understand user behavior, monitor platform engagement levels, and assess the effectiveness of marketing efforts or promotions conducted during that period

### **Query 06: Average amount of money spent per session. Only include purchaser data in July 2017**
- SQL Code
```sql
SELECT
  FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m',PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d',date)) as month
  ,ROUND((SUM(product.productRevenue) /SUM(totals.visits)) /1000000,3) AS avg_revenue_by_user_per_visit --avagerate revenue by user per visit
  from 
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_201707*`

    AND product.productRevenue IS NOT NULL --must add this condition to ensure revenue
GROUP BY
  month;
```
|month|Avg_revenue_by_user_per_visit|
|-----|-------------------------------|
|201707|4.857            |

In July 2017, the average revenue generated per user per visit amounted to 43.857. This indicates that, on average, users spent around 44 during that time. Such a metric serves as a valuable tool for businesses to gauge user engagement and monitor overall activity levels.

### **Query 07: Other products purchased by customers who purchased product "YouTube Men's Vintage Henley" in July 2017. Output should show product name and the quantity was ordered.**

The table highlights inventory levels, with Google Sunglasses having the highest quantity (20) and several items, like Google Lip Balm and YouTube Hoodies, having the lowest quantity (2). This snapshot is useful for managing stock or planning replenishment strategies.

### **Query 08: Calculate cohort map from product view to addtocart to purchase in Jan, Feb and March 2017. For example, 100% product view then 40% add_to_cart and 10% purchase.Add_to_cart_rate = number product  add to cart/number product view. Purchase_rate = number product purchase/number product view. The output should be calculated in product level.**
